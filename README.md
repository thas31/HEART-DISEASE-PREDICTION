# HEART-DISEASE-PREDICTION
This repository contains code and resources for predicting the risk of heart disease using machine learning algorithms. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at higher risk of developing cardiovascular problems.
Dataset
The project utilizes the Heart Disease UCI dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains various clinical attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and diagnostic test results, along with the presence or absence of heart disease.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and encode categorical variables.
Feature Selection: Relevant features are selected using statistical analysis and domain knowledge to improve the predictive performance of the model.
Model Selection: Various machine learning algorithms including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines are trained and evaluated.
Model Evaluation: The performance of each model is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid search or random search techniques are employed to optimize the hyperparameters of the selected models.
Results
The trained models achieve promising results in predicting the presence or absence of heart disease based on the input features. The best-performing model is selected based on its evaluation metrics and can be deployed for real-world use.
